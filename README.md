Project Description

The REST API Client Application is a Java-based console application developed to demonstrate how Java programs can consume RESTful web services using Core Java.

This project follows a layered MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture, ensuring proper separation of concerns and clean code structure. It is designed for beginners to understand API communication, HTTP requests, and JSON responses in a structured and professional manner.

The application interacts with a public REST API and displays the fetched data on the console.

Features

Consume public REST APIs using Java

Send HTTP GET requests

Read and display JSON responses

Menu-driven console interface

Layered MVC architecture

Proper exception handling

Project Architecture

The project follows a three-layer architecture:

Controller Layer

Handles user input, menu selection, and forwards requests to the Service layer.

Service Layer

Contains business logic and acts as an intermediary between Controller and DAO layers.

DAO Layer

Handles HTTP connections, API calls, and response processing using Java networking and IO classes.

REST API Used

Public API: Age Prediction API

Request Method: GET

Response Format: JSON

Technologies Used

Java

Java Networking (java.net)

Java IO Package

Java Util Package

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts



Conclusion

This project demonstrates key Java concepts such as REST API consumption, HTTP communication, JSON response handling, and layered application architecture. It provides a strong foundation for beginners learning real-world Java API integration.
